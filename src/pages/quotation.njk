  Flexibility and configurability are key to calculating and controlling pricing to ensure profitability. In the example
  above, margins are highlighted to users to show compliance at-a-glance.
</p>
<h2 class="fw-bolder ggt">Pricing Calculations</h2>
<p>
  Pricing calculations can consider:
  <strong>
    Quantity, Panel Volume, Cost, Yield, Manufacturability, Lead Time, Service Level, PCB Class, ITAR, Military Spec,
    Expidite
  </strong>
  and any other required factor.
</p>
<h2 class="fw-bolder ggt">Detailed Attribute & Cost Analysis</h2>
<p>Users can drill down into the factors driving the calculated cost and review the characteristics of the PCB.</p>
